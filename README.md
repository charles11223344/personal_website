Lemon-Themed Portfolio üçã

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site is a vibrant, lemon-inspired showcase of my skills, projects, and professional journey as a full-stack developer and UI/UX enthusiast. Built with modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features interactive widgets, responsive design, and a playful yet professional aesthetic.

Features

- Lemon-Themed Design: A fresh, bright, and energetic look inspired by lemons, reflecting my approach to development‚Äîclean, purposeful, and full of zest.
- Responsive Layout: The site adapts beautifully to all screen sizes, ensuring a great experience on desktop and mobile devices.
- Weather Widget: Real-time weather information for your chosen city, powered by the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Hiding Crypto Prices: Live Bitcoin and Ethereum prices in CAD, fetched from the CoinGecko API and displayed with official coin icons.
- Skills & Projects: A detailed list of my technical skills and selected projects, with links to GitHub repositories.
- Timeline: Highlights of my professional milestones and achievements.
- Testimonials: Feedback from colleagues and collaborators.
- Contact Form: A simple, secure contact form powered by Formspree for easy communication.

How It Works

- The weather widget fetches current data from OpenWeatherMap using your API key and displays temperature, description, and icon.
- The crypto widget fetches live prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum from CoinGecko and displays them with their respective logos.
- All sections are styled for clarity and visual appeal, using CSS custom properties and animations.
